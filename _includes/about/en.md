Hello there, I'm Zhang Hangyu, a young professional with a keen interest in Computer Science and Statistics. I'm currently based in mainland China, but I also fancy the idea of being a digital nomad.

In this blog, I'll be sharing my insights and experiences in the realms of Computer Science and Statistics, as well as documenting my journey and reflections as a digital nomad.

I hope that my blog can provide you with fresh perspectives and I look forward to engaging with you in a mutual learning process. If you find my blog intriguing, or if you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
